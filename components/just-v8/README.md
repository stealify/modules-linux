# Just or JustJS or just-v8 how it is called now
Is a small ECMAScript Runtime Created by the justjs Project maintained by a single person which found good patterns to turn v8 into a small self building Runtime. 

It inspired me the creator of the Stealify Project to switch from GraalVM to self building ECMAScript Runtimes in general. I Understood that the concept is the successor to raw c++ usage in general.

It makes the C++ or any other code as well more modular and allows us to create script able versions of it as also secure the code execution via sandboxing it also seen by the WASM concept. Overall we take the best of all Worlds OS and Browser Platform Development to create Modular Component based builds that can get scripted and reused in a variaty of ways never matched before without rebuilding them from source.

As also on Top this builds are proven to be the most fast in real world framework benchmarks.
See: https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r21&test=composite

It ranks at the First Place outperforming the most optimized raw c++ frameworks this does not depend on diffrent nativ code it simply uses it more efficent and composes it more efficent.

If you want to get familar with the history of the project you should visit: https://github.com/just-js/just where just started. Give the Maintainer love or help us or him to even make this more efficent and performant if you got any inspirations your welcome. It really just starts here there is a lot of space for improvments that are not applyed at present.
