# FS Module
This Represents the FileSystem you can interact with it via its Methods

Some Methods are by design NodeJS Compatible but not all for example we have
a unified mkdir behavior that supports a create if parents exist flag 
that allows you to do something like mkdirp but with some more control about
the outcome of that command that saves you from writing the logic on your own.
